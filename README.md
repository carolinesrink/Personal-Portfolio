# Personal-Portfolio

This is my personal portfolio.

Some JavaScript implementations are currently under construction and will be posted around the end of September.

This current portfolio utilizes HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap. I also used Adobe Photoshop to edit photos and Adode XD to wireframe the design.
